We are used to hearing how sp_erm is used to cure pimples and acne and though some people found it disgusting and “ewwwed” to the thought, some have found ourselves using it on our faces with the hope of smoothing our faces. I would leave the eventual result for some other day and delve into the heart of this article.
Apparently what we didn’t know was the fact that va_ginal discharge can be used to actually bleach the skin, cure acne and even malaria. One woman claims she made the discovery. “Here is the real secret to smooth flawless skin, stick your finger into your honey pot and scoop some discharge, tongue is a good tester to alkaline level of the porridge of life. If the discharge from your nun can bleach your panties, what makes you think it can’t cure malaria? mums you have a cheap and natural solution to a smooth skin in between your legs. Rub the discharge on your face before going to bed and report here after 7 days,” her update read in part. Though no doctor has come out to confirm this, the said woman is so sure of her discovery and has urged ladies to try it for themselves. Source : Online !
