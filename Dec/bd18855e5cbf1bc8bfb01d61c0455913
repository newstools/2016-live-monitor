Former Generations star Slindile “Mam Ruby” Nodangala has opened a s_ex school in a bid to make money after falling on hard times following her exit from the show in 2015. The actress, who owned a shebeen in Generations said she failed to secure good paying jobs after her Generations exit thus decided to open the school from her home in Umlazi, Durban. Her school mainly caters for those women with big bodies. Speaking to LiveMonitor, Slindile said , “A lot of big women are losing their men to these slender bodies because they are not flexible in bed. I opened this school to help all women who are big and want to improve their s_ex game,” she said and invited us into one of her classes which had 8 women. On woman who has been married for 7 years said since she joined the school, she has learnt a lot and her husband is happy. The s_ex school has become so popular that there is a waiting list until March 2017. “I have stopped taking acting roles because the money is peanuts. I will now live on this and plan to open a new branch in a provinces”, the bubbly Slindile said. Source:LiveMonitor ! These content links are provided by Content.ad.
