Durban-A couple who couldn’t wait to get to the bedroom caused a scene recently at Mitchell’s Park after deciding to sample the forbidden fruit in public. The unidentified man and his girlfriend started kissing passionately and seconds later the girl was on the guy’s lap, screaming and moaning in pleasure. So loud were the screams they attracted the attention of people in the park who rushed to the scene and started taking photos of the incident. The Park security seeing the huge crowd in one place then rushed to the scene and wanted to break up the couple. “The guy was furious when the Park security were trying to remove him from his girlfriend.All we heard him say was “Ngilinde nja yaam Ng’ya qeda” (translated ‘Don’t disturb you mampara am coming). “To make matters worse he snatched the guard ‘s baton stick before trying to assault him with his er_ect 4-5.He was immediately subdued by the security team who handed them over to the Police,” said one of the witnesses who refused to be named. The video has since started doing rounds on social media and has raised alarm over how society is becoming to obsessed with the bedroom game and the norms they are willing to break to get what they want.
