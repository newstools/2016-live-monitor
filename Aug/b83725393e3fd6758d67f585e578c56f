Controversial man of God and founder of the International Godâ€™s Way Church, Bishop Daniel Obinim, has sparked another controversy after he was captured in a video whipping teenage church members he accused of sleeping around. In one instance, a lady in the 3-minute video, was seen wailing after being subjected to inhumane treatment by the supposed Man of God who is believed to be thriving on series of controversies recently. It is unclear which part of the bible justifies the conduct of Bishop Obinim who used a black leather belt severely beating the poor congregants until the female sought refuge in Florence Obinim, but assistant went for her and handed her over to his boss. Another young man was equally not spared the torture of Bishop Daniel Obinim who has always found justification for whatever he does.  Source : Online !
