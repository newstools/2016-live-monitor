South Africa’s funniest man, Trevor Noah has become the first victim of the new American president after he was detained for deportation earlier today. Trevor, host of popular show, The Daily Show, has been vocal in showing support for Hillary Clinton. It is reported the American Home Affairs issued the deportation letter to Trevor just an hour after it was announced Donald had won. In the letter, it was cited that Trevor was to voluntarily leave American soil within 24 hours of receiving the letter failure of which would result in the forceful removal of offender. Part of the letter read : “The offender of South African origin,  Trevor Noah’s, has repeatedly undermined the office of the president and on several occasions called the president names such as douchebag and moron”. It goes on to say, “President Donald Trump hereby revokes Trevor’s rights to stay in American. He must go and say his nonsense elsewhere.” The news was met with shock among South Africans with some saying they did expect it. Trevor Noah was not available for comment as it was believed he was too distraught to talk. Source : LiveMonitor Satire !  These content links are provided by Content.ad.
