Social media users have mocked Nigerian prophet TB Joshua following his inaccurate prophecy regarding the winner of the just ended United States elections. The Synagogue Church of nations (SCOAN) founder predicted early this week that Democrats leader Hillary Clinton would win the US presidential election in a “narrow victory” against her Republican rival Donald Trump. He made the disclosure while speaking to a packed congregation at the SCOAN on Sunday. TB Jushua claimed that he saw it all in a vision 10 days ago. The cleric prophesied that the female candidate would win the coveted position and shared his “vision” on his Facebook page which is followed by over 2.5 million people. He also, on the other hand, lauded Clinton’s outspoken opponent Donald Trump: “I want to salute the opposition – a very strong man and courageous. But, on Wednesday morning, in a closely contested election, Trump was declared victorious, after capturing Wisconsin’s 10 electoral votes, putting him over the 270 threshold. Voters eager to shake up the nation’s political establishment picked the celebrity businessman to become the nation’s 45th president.     Source-Daily Sun !
