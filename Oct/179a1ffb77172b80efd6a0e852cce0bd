Knowing if a lady is a wife material or not involves a man trying out one or more of these smart things. 1. Demand for pre-marital s_ex In some religious organisations in Nigeria, their leaders lay much emphasis on abstinence from s_ex before marriage. However, this is not the case in some religious organisations. They do not preach against pre-marital s_ex. A man who asked a woman out and later on the woman herself says she wants s_ex should be cautious of such woman. 2. Take her to a restaurant This is one of the most effective ways to know if a lady is a wife material or not. A well brought up and responsible lady will eat little or nothing when her potential husband takes her to a fast food joint. On the other hand, a woman who is not sincere about marriage will order what she can never buy with her money. She will eat food worth thousands of Rands. She eats in and takes away. She will say to herself that the man who bought the food for her is a big fool. She will not bother to call the man the following day to say thank you. 3. Shopping freak A non-wife material woman is crazy about shopping. She wants the man to buy all sorts of expensive dresses and jewelleries for her. She does not think about the purse of the man. She does not think of planning with the man to save his salary. Even if the man spends beyond his monthly earnings on her, she does not care. She wants everything for herself. 4. Demand for money Ladies who are wife materials are very considerate. They hardly ask money from a man who is in a relationship with them. They do not ask money for recharge cards or chocolates. They do not want things that will incur expense and be a burden on the man. They are very shy in demanding money. This is because they know the man will still spend on them when he marries them. However, women who only love demanding money every now and then should be looked by men with a second eye. 5. Interest in your parents, especially mothers Wives and mothers-in-law are hardly the best of friends. It may surprise some men when ladies they have interest to marry ask if they still have mothers or not. A selfish wife material does not want to see her mother-in-law at all. She believes in, “me and my husband.” She sees her mother-in-law as a major obstacle to her having a happy matrimonial home. This is however not the case. Her disposition towards her marital life is a key to her having a happy marriage life. In addition, some men these days subtly ask their potential wives various questions to know if they will be the one to marry or that they will still need to look elsewhere. The answers these men get assist them to know if a lady is a wife material or not. Source : Online ! These content links are provided by Content.ad.
