Mabala Noice rapper, Nasty C told Mzansi how much his grillz cost in an interview on Metro FMearlier this week. Speaking to Lerato Kganyago and Mo Flava, the rapper said his grillz cost him R105 000, with a discount included.
The 19-year-old might might just have the most expensive set of grillz in Mzansi! Not even King Kotini’s grillz are that expensive, whose grillz are said to be worth R80 000.
