Popular pastor and self-styled marriage counsellor,Rev. Counselor Cyril George Lutterodt, who is known widely known for his controversial stance on relationship issues has indicated that couples who enjoy doggy style s*x position a lot divorce early. Counsellor Lutterodt made this assertion when he appeared on Love and Relationship, a television talk show aired on Screw TV, as a guest. According to him, most marriages end up in shambles because the couples involved choose doggy style over the conventional missionary position. He said, “Today, people don’t understand why many marriages are collapsing. The truth is, young couples engage in doggy style too much and that is the cause of most marriage breakups.” Counselor LutterodtAsked why he thinks engaging in doggy style causes breakup in marriages, Counselor Lutterodt said often, one of the couples sees the other as an animal, especially a dog so whenever a problem arises, the one who sees the other as an animal will tease his/her partner for being a dog. This, he said, leads to bigger arguments which eventually ends up in divorce. Counselor Lutterodt therefore advised all married couples to desist from practicing doggy style if they want their marriages to last long. Source : Online !
